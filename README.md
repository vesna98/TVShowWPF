# TV Show WPF Application

Through this project in 3rd year I had the opportunity to apply design patterns such as Singleton, Command, Factory & Proxy in a C# with MVVM architecture.
The project is designed as a WPF application, where the user can add series by entering the appropriate attributes such as series name and episodes, also the user can delete and change data.
